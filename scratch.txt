Chopping block:
- Clean up code related to config
    - I know this would be good to do, but I don't feel like it right now
- Storing config in URL
    - Potential problem due to URLs being limited in length and converting formless URL text to Typescript-friendly object
- Tone.js integration
    - Pretty big undertaking
- WebRTC integration
    - Gonna need to have a signaling server to handle the initial handshake, will also probably need a QR code library
- Writing more charts
    - 8 step sequencer, mack the knife, moondance, lonely rolling star, bass-line generator, in c

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We start load a chart:
    - Clear the controllers
    - Load the event generator object

We play a chart:
    - We read the first event's time
    - We compute a timeout from now to when the event should be handled
    - We schedule a timeout to handle the event:
        - If its a compute event, we don't do anything
        - If its a note on event, we pass it to the part's synth
        - If its a note off event, we pass it to the part's synth
        - We read the next event
            - If there are no more events, we don't do anything
            - If there is another event, we compute a timeout from now to when the event should be handled
