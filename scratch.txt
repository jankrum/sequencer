Notes of what to do next:
- Storing config in URL
    - Potential problem due to URLs being limited in length and converting formless URL text to Typescript-friendly object
- Clean up code related to config
    - I know this would be good to do, but I don't feel like it right now
- Tone.js integration
    - Pretty big undertaking
- WebRTC integration
    - Gonna need to have a signaling server to handle the initial handshake, will also probably need a QR code library
- Planned tempo changes, accelerando, ritardando 
    - Maybe this isn't in buffer but in the compose func with callbacks and helper.ts
- Buffer events taking multiple parts for finish events and multiple notes for note-on/note-off events
    - Easy to do
- Writing more charts
    - 8 step sequencer, mack the knife, moondance, lonely rolling star, bass-line generator, in c
